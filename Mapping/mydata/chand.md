Mapping person-to-person variation in viral mutations that escape antibodies of SARS-CoV 2.

Protein 6M0J => ACE2-bound RBD structure

When you click on sites, they will be highlighted on the protein structure of the ACE2-bound RBD (PDB 6M0J, or antibody-bound RBD structures (PDB 6XDG and PDB 7C01).

At the site level you can visualize one of two quantities:

  total escape is the sum of the escape from all mutations at a site.

  max escape is the magnitude of the largest-effect escape mutation at each site.

At the mutation level, the height of each letter is proportional to the extent to which that amino-acid mutation escapes antibody binding. You can color the logo plot letters in four ways:

  escape color ACE2 bind means color letters according to how that mutation affects ACE2 binding as measured in our prior deep mutational scanning (Starr et al. (2020), with yellow meaning highly deleterious, and brown meaning neutral or beneficial for ACE2 binding. See Figure 1 in the preprint linked above for color scale.

  escape color RBD expr means color letters according to how that mutation affects RBD expression as measured in Starr et al. (2020).

  escape color gray means color all letters gray.

  escape color func group means color letters by functional group.
